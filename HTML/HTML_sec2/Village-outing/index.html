            <p>We have a deep connection to villages and the village lifestyle. As a kid, we never got bored of coming
                home after the last exam paper only to start packing and to leave for village without wasting a single
                second. But every good things ends and so did our childhood. Sigh!

                We grew up and started slogging in the workplaces till the hour hand and minute hand started to
                disappear slowly. We engross ourselves in office work and forget about our personal life completely. But
                here is a chance to re-live and re-visit our childhood experience again. Village Outing or (Patalache
                Gaav or Patilâ€™s Village) has presented this amazing opportunity of camping near Pune to people like us.
